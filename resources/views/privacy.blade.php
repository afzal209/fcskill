                improving the Services.And I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this
                Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="fs-6 mt-3">The terms used in this privacy policy have the same meaning as in our Terms and Conditions,
                which are accessible at FCskill unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="fs-6 mt-3">No representation is being made for any account will or is likely to achieve profits or
                losses similar to those shown. Account performance results are hypothetical. Every investor's goals and risk
                tolerance differ, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Our signals, analysis, news etc
                are just as prediction so you can take the trading risk on your own risk. These results are not necessarily
                representative of the performance which may be achieved by other clients using FCskill.</p>
            <p class="fs-6 mt-3">Hypothetical performance results are designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of a
                trading strategy over a period of time. These hypothetical results do not represent actual performance and
                are not indicative of how an actual investment will perform. One limitation of hypothetical performance
                results is they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. Hypothetical trading does not involve
                financial risk, and no hypothetical trading records can completely account for the impact of financial risk
                in actual trading. For example, if there is a loss on a position, there is no guarantee that these losses
                will be covered by profits on other positions or that this will continue in the future. Also, past
                performance does not guarantee future results."</p>
